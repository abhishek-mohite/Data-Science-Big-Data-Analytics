5)	Write a survey report on types of Blockchains.

# Survey Report on Types of Blockchains

**Introduction:**
Blockchains are a revolutionary technology that has gained widespread attention and adoption in various industries, 
providing secure and transparent methods of storing and sharing data. Blockchains come in various types, each with 
unique characteristics and use cases. In this survey report, we explore the three main types of blockchains: Public, 
Private, and Consortium, discussing their features, advantages, and applications.

## 1. Public Blockchains

**Features:**
- **Decentralization:** Public blockchains are open to anyone, allowing for a decentralized network where anyone 
can participate.
- **Permissionless:** No permission is required to join the network or access its data.
- **Security:** Public blockchains rely on cryptographic algorithms to secure data and transactions.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are visible to all participants, enhancing transparency and trust.

**Advantages:**
- **Global Participation:** Public blockchains are accessible worldwide, allowing for global participation.
- **Censorship Resistance:** These blockchains are resistant to censorship, as no central authority can control them.
- **Immutability:** Data recorded on public blockchains is difficult to alter, ensuring trust in the system.

**Applications:**
- Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Decentralized applications (DApps)
- Smart contracts

## 2. Private Blockchains

**Features:**
- **Centralized Control:** Private blockchains are operated and controlled by a single entity or a consortium 
of trusted parties.
- **Permissioned:** Access to the network is restricted and controlled by the entity or consortium.
- **Privacy:** Data on private blockchains is not visible to the public.

**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency:** Private blockchains are more efficient than public ones, as they have fewer participants and 
higher transaction speeds.
- **Data Privacy:** These blockchains are suitable for businesses that require data privacy and confidentiality.
- **Customization:** The entity or consortium can customize the blockchain to suit their specific needs.

**Applications:**
- Supply chain management
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare data management

## 3. Consortium Blockchains

**Features:**
- **Semi-Decentralization:** Consortium blockchains are controlled by a group of organizations, striking a balance 
between public and private blockchains.
- **Permissioned:** Access is limited to the consortium members.
- **Security:** They maintain a higher level of security compared to public blockchains.

**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency:** Consortium blockchains are more efficient and faster than public blockchains.
- **Trust:** Consortium members are typically trusted entities, which enhances trust within the network.
- **Customization:** Similar to private blockchains, consortium blockchains can be customized to meet specific industry needs.

**Applications:**
- Cross-industry collaborations
- Supply chain networks
- Joint ventures


6)	Present a case study on any one Blockchain application.

**Case Study: Blockchain in Supply Chain Management**

*Abstract:*

This case study explores the application of blockchain technology in supply chain management, 
focusing on a real-world example that demonstrates the benefits of increased transparency, 
traceability, and efficiency in the supply chain.

**Introduction:**

Supply chain management is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders, from manufacturers 
to suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. Ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the 
supply chain is critical for businesses to deliver quality products, manage inventory, and meet customer 
demands. Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool to address these challenges by providing 
transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain.

**Case Study: IBM Food Trust**

One prominent example of blockchain technology transforming supply chain management is the IBM Food Trust platform. 
Launched by IBM in collaboration with major food companies, it aims to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness 
of the food supply chain.

**Key Objectives:**

- Ensure food safety and traceability.
- Reduce food waste and fraud.
- Improve the efficiency of the supply chain.

**Implementation:**

1. **Data Entry and Validation:** Participants in the supply chain, including growers, suppliers, processors, 
distributors, retailers, and regulators, input data about food products. Each transaction or data entry is 
recorded as a block on the blockchain.

2. **Consensus Mechanism:** A permissioned blockchain network is used, meaning only authorized participants can 
validate and add new blocks. This enhances security and data accuracy.

3. **Traceability:** Each product is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., QR code) that consumers and stakeholders 
can scan to access detailed information about the product's journey, including origin, processing, and distribution.

4. **Data Sharing:** Participants can access the blockchain to verify the authenticity of products and review the 
history of each item. This real-time transparency helps in identifying issues and responding quickly to food safety 
incidents.

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Traceability:** The blockchain ensures end-to-end visibility, reducing the time and resources required 
to trace contaminated products and minimizing the impact of foodborne illnesses.

- **Improved Food Safety:** Rapid identification and recall of contaminated or unsafe products help prevent foodborne 
diseases and protect consumers.

- **Reduction in Food Waste:** Accurate tracking reduces food waste by enabling precise expiration date management, 
which, in turn, reduces environmental impact.

- **Increased Trust:** The transparent supply chain fosters trust among consumers, as they can access trustworthy 
information about the products they consume.

- **Operational Efficiency:** Participants benefit from streamlined supply chain operations and reduced manual 
record-keeping, which improves efficiency and reduces costs.

**Challenges:**

- **Adoption:** Encouraging all participants in the supply chain to adopt the blockchain technology and consistently 
input data can be a challenge.

- **Integration:** Integrating blockchain with existing systems and technologies may require effort and resources.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring data privacy can be complex, especially in 
highly regulated industries.

**Conclusion:**

The IBM Food Trust case study demonstrates how blockchain technology is transforming the food supply chain. By increasing 
transparency, traceability, and efficiency, blockchain solutions like this one have the potential to improve safety, reduce waste, 
and build trust among consumers. The success of this application paves the way for the broader adoption of blockchain in supply 
chain management across various industries.
